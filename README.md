The dataset used was from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales) the dataset shape is 1000 rows and 13 columns. Data quality assessment was conducted to ensure the data is accurate, free from null values and consisent and also relevant to the analysis objectives.
* ##### DATA CLEANING
The following common data quality issues were checked with the help of pandas library which is well suited for data manipulation and data cleaning.  
* Missing data
* Inconsistent data formatting
* Outliers
* Duplicates
* Incorrect data type
* Renaming columns
   
 The dataset was further refined by correcting erros of data type mismatches , renamed columns and further removed columns which were not applicable to my analysis. 

* #### DATA EXPLORATION
  Data exploration techinques were employed which involves descriptive statistics to provide summary statistics(mean, mode, median, quartiles,standard deviation,etc) to have a rough understanding of the data before diving deep into earthing insights. Histograms, boxplot/whisker, kernel density were of use to help with identifying outliers,patterns and trends in the dataset.
